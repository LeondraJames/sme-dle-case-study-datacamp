# Plotly

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The goal of exercises in case study is for learners to apply what was learned previous courses to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. Since the courses covered are conceptual, students will rely on manipulating the interactive visualizations that you create to practice their skills.



## Creating a Plotly explorable

#### Dataset

- [ ] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [ ] **Python source**: Add your plotly app to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `app.py`. Please ensure your app includes all the packages required so we are able to evaluate it locally. The app should use the dataset from the `datasets/` folder.
- [ ] **HTML Export**: Export your plotly app as an interactive HTML file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `render.html`. [Plotly support reference](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/) on rendering an interactive HTML file.


#### Learning Objective

*One measurable learning objective that this exercise assesses*

#### Context

*3 - 4 sentence description of why itâ€™s important to to do this task (linking back to the learning objective). Explain how this would be used in a real-life situation. Why is it useful, what problem does it solve?*

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- ...

#### Exercise question:
*This is a question presented to learners to check if the steps above were properly completed. It can be a multiple choice question or a question with a 1-3 word answer. It is often not possible to check if all the steps are completed, in this case; the priority is to check that the learner meets the learning objective.*

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
